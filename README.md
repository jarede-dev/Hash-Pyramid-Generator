# Hash-Pyramid-Generator

**A C program that generates a hash pyramid of your choice**


**Usage:**

 1. Get your ***Mac*** or ***Linux*** environment up-and-running (cus why would you ever run and compile a C program in Windows?).
 2. Compile the program using your favorite C compiler. I recommend ***GCC***.
 3. After compiling, run the program then enter the number that corresponds to the pyramid of your choice.
 4. Enter the height of the pyramid that you desire.
 5. Enjoy!
